The end scene got lost. Unfortunately. It will return with some development efforts.

Most of the game is fine and works perfect.

This is an attempt made about 4 years ago to create a rhythm game that could resemble Hatsune Miku with beats. 

The mechanics are pretty simple: 
    Either you press the buttons or press z, x, c, and b.
    Each one for each beat color, which can be blue, green, yellow and 
    purple
