The end scene got lost. Unfortunately. It will return with some development efforts.

Most of the game is fine and works perfect.

This is an attempt made about 4 years ago to create a rhythm game that could resemble Hatsune Miku with beats. 

The mechanics are pretty simple: 
    Either you click the buttons or press z, x, c, and b.
    Each one for each beat color, which can be blue, green, yellow and 
    purple

The development of this video game was really poor, it was a moment in my life in which I had severe issues, both health and economic. It surprises me it was at least good. 

I don't want to make the long story about my life or the stoppers I could have while trying to make a rhythm game, that's never ok. 

We will jump straight into the game.

The four buttons give a specific beat, while bars of colors appear within the roller, you have to match the bars with the beats. There is a white progress bar on top of the screen that indicates progress.

I think it's a possible good mobile game. What do you think?

Unfortunately there are no executables to test for players! (yet)
